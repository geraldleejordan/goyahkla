Chiricahua
Removing themselves from the boxcar,
adjusting to the light of day,
wondering where this could be,
what was now in store
they touched the earth,
feet seeming to float above the land
as if it did not want them,
or they did not belong.
Goyahkla heard the howl of the coyote,
it is a good sign,
They are home -
or close to the land
of their ancestors.

No one is your friend,
but your legs,
your legs are your friends.
