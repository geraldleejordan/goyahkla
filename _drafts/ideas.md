- A first person section, where I speak to Goyahkla

- killing their own dogs to escape from the forced move to San Carlos (the sound of the dogs could have alerted enemy soliders)

- being forced from their land to SC

- hearing the visions of "The Dreamer" after four years of trying to "farm" in SC

- Geronimo as "everyman", being exploited by the system

Brainstorm "significant" events and then build poem from these (perhaps in unexpected sequence):

- Meeting The Dreamer
- Killing his dog to get away from the soldiers wanting to take them to SC
- Freezing in the ditch
- Last words
- Death of mother, wife and three children
- Humiliation at hands of soldiers
- Voice in desert telling him that bullets would not harm him
- sound of coyote in Oklahoma
- Longing for home

"Once I moved about like the wind. Now I surrender to you and that is all."
Statement to General George Crook (25 March 1886)

November 1907 - Oklahoma becomes a state

They are gone,
never will I see their eyes,
dark as the deepest night.

They are gone,
will they run with usen?

All that I knew is no longer.

Poem setting is the last hours in ditch and deathbed. Focus jumps from sensations of being wet and freezing, to images of his life, back to physical sensations. Ends with his deathbed statement to his nephew.
