- A first person section, where I speak to Goyahkla

- killing their own dogs to escape from the forced move to San Carlos (the sound of the dogs could have alerted enemy soliders)

- being forced from their land to SC

- hearing the visions of "The Dreamer" after four years of trying to "farm" in SC

- Geronimo as "everyman", being exploited by the system

Brainstorm "significant" events and then build poem from these (perhaps in unexpected sequence):

- Meeting The Dreamer
- Killing his dog to get away from the soldiers wanting to take them to SC
- Freezing in the ditch
- Last words
- Death of mother, wife and three children
- Humiliation at hands of soldiers
- Voice in desert telling him that bullets would not harm him

"Once I moved about like the wind. Now I surrender to you and that is all."
Statement to General George Crook (25 March 1886)
